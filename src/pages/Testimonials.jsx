      comment: `Joshua is one of the most hardworking and smart people I have met at
  work. His coding skills are impeccable and he is always up, learning
  something new to improve his skills even more. Working with him has
  been nothing but a great pleasure and he always does more than what is
  necessaryâ€”often going out of his way to do something *just* right.
  Lastly, Josh is a great person: immensely friendly, with a great
  attitude towards, always honest and down to earth. He's the sort of no
  bullshit kind of guy with a bag of interesting stories. Somebody you
  can be glad to have on your team.`,

He is kind, funny and honest and it's with these characteristics in mind that I would happily recommend him for any team that is considering him. They would be lucky to have him because I would like to see him stay in mine.`,
